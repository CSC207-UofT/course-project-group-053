/* Below is the PlayerManager class.
 * (through csv files) keeps records of player game history (wins, losses) and creates user
 * accounts and give them unique usernames so that we can can calculate the
 * probability of winning/losing as per the users.
 * Keep track of playerâ€™s chips on board
 * Allows players to make moves on a game board -> slide or place chip
 *
 * AS OF NOW, PlayerManager is being designed to control a single player, meaning that in a multiplayer game,
 * each player would have different PlayerManager objects.
 *
 * There will be a csv file for each player. Those files will have dates as rows, each consisting
 * of the player's scores at that specific date in yyyy/mm/dd. E.g.
 * 2021/10/11, 230.5, 300.5, 190.84, 32.5
 * 2021/10/12, 453.33, 230.4
 *
 * Note that what will be used to calculate high scores is still not defined (is it time, moves, etc.?).
