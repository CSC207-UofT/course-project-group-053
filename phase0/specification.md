# Project domain: Nine Men Morris - 2 player board game

# Project description:

Running the program launches a graphical interface, depicting the game board used for Nine Men Morris. Players will be asked whether they want to play against another human player (someone sharing the computer with them), or a computer player. Then, players are prompted to enter their username and choice of game piece ("token") color.

The game takes on two phases. In the first phase, players can place their tokens on the game board, by clicking on positions on the screen. When a player gets three of their pieces in a row, horizontally or vertically, they form a "house". When they form a house, they can remove one of their opponent's tokens, and their tokens in the house cannot be removed by their opponent. The first phase ends when players have put all their tokens on the game board.

In the second phase, players can slide their tokens across the board, to try and form houses and eliminate the other player's tokens. The game ends when one player has only two tokens left, as they can no longer form houses. This player loses, and the other player wins.

Moreover, when players enter their usernames at the start, our program will also keep track of each player. Our program will note the number of games played, wins, and other statistics for that username. When a previously used username is entered by a player, the program will record information from the current game for that username.
