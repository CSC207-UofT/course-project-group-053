# Project domain: 9 men morris multiplayer game

# Project description:

The project so far is a command-line version of the Nine Men's Morris board game, for two players to play. Launching the program prompts the first player to enter their player name, and what color they want their game pieces (tokens) to be. The program then prompts the same information from the second player. After this, the game starts, and players are shown an ASCII graphic of the gameboard. Players take turns typing in the command line, specifying the coordinates where they want to place their game pieces. When players get their game tokens to form horizontal or vertical stacks on the gameboard (a "house"), they can remove one of their opponent's tokens from the board if they are not also in a house. The game ends when both players run out of tokens to place.
