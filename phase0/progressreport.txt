Challenges: The ideation phase is always challenging. 
It took a while to get in the flow of things as a team. 
There were some changes that were made to the gameboard to ensure that the game 
could be played in the most efficient way possible. We also had some challenges 
regarding github specifically when it came to committing that were sorted in our second in-person meeting. 

Open Questions your group is still struggling with:
Since we have most of our logic for how the first phase of our game will work, 
there are not a lot of open questions that we have on my end. For Phase 2, 
the game itself does not much change in terms of its logic but more in the 
kinds of rules that are allowed. For our team, the next step and perhaps the most 
challenging one is going to be ensuring a boundary for what moves are allowed according 
to the rules and keeping them in check since the game moves from placing tokens to sliding 
the pre-existing tokens already on the board. There are also some variations on this game 
where skipping tokens may be allowed which is a design choice and open question that still 
needs to be addressed (this would be our phase 3). In addition, some open questions are also 
to what extent we want to display player data in terms of their previous statistics.


Summary:
At this point GameBoardManager is working to see where on the board the token has been placed 
and making a record of it, and the Player class keeps track of how many tokens the Players are 
left with and how many of Players tokens are on the board.
If no exceptions are thrown and players move is valid, GameBoardManager keeps a track of what 
has been changed and stores it and outputs the state of the board for the Players to see.
The code starts at the Main class where it would ask for Input from the user to enter the names 
of two Human Players and the colour the first Human Player chooses.
So when the Input is received, HumanPlayer, which is the subclass of Player initializes two player 
instances and stores the name of player, the token colour of the player, and initializes the number 
of chips as 9 and sets the number of chips on the board to 0.
The same is the case of when (wlog) Player1 forms a mill and gets to remove opponents token, GameBoardManager 
validates the move and then stores the move and then outputs the state of the board.
