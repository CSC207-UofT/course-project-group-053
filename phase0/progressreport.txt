Challenges: The ideation phase is always challenging. 
It took a while to get in the flow of things as a team. 
There were some changes that were made to the gameboard to ensure that the game 
could be played in the most efficient way possible. We also had some challenges 
regarding github specifically when it came to committing that were sorted in our second in-person meeting.
