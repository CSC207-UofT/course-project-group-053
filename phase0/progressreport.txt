Challenges: The ideation phase is always challenging. 
It took a while to get in the flow of things as a team. 
There were some changes that were made to the gameboard to ensure that the game 
could be played in the most efficient way possible. We also had some challenges 
regarding github specifically when it came to committing that were sorted in our second in-person meeting. 

Open Questions your group is still struggling with:
Since we have most of our logic for how the first phase of our game will work, there are not a lot of open questions that we have on my end. For Phase 2, the game itself does not much change in terms of its logic but more in the kinds of rules that are allowed. For our team, the next step and perhaps the most challenging one is going to be ensuring a boundary for what moves are allowed according to the rules and keeping them in check since the game moves from placing tokens to sliding the pre-existing tokens already on the board. There are also some variations on this game where skipping tokens may be allowed which is a design choice and open question that still needs to be addressed (this would be our phase 3)
