The game nine men Morris has two phases. In the beginning of the game, the two 
users playing will be asked their names. Player 1 and Player 2 will then choose either 
black or white as their token colour. During both of the phases, if a player gets three 
of their tokens i.e. tokens of the same colour in 3 places either vertically or 
horizontally in a way that each token is adjacent to the next on the board, a house is 
made. Once a house is made, the player who made the house can take the other playerâ€™s 
token off the board. An opponents tokens that have been removed cannot be placed back 
on the board (I.e. you can only place your own tokens). 

In Phase I, each player will have 9 tokens and the game board has 24 open spaces for the 
players to place their tokens. Each player will take turns in placing the tokens until all 
18 tokens have been placed and then Phase 2 begins. In Phase 2, players can slide their tokens 
to adjacent points on the board. A piece cannot jump over other pieces and can only move to 
unoccupied spaces on the board. Once a player is left with 2 tokens and can no longer make 
another house, their opponent wins.
