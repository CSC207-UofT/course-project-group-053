Run main
Main asks for user input to specify player names and player token colors
Main instantiates and calls PlayerManager to store instances of new players + tokens (?)
Main instantiates new GameBoardManager instance to store instance of empty GameBoard
Main runs loop to keep asking for user inputs, to specify where they want to place their tokens on the board
During loop, main passes the user inputs to GameBoardManager, to process player requests to place tokens on board
Loop ends when GameBoardManager determines that both players have placed max number of tokens on GameBoard
